            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The Lord <hi>Abbot</hi> told him, he gave him many thanks for the freedom he used, and withal, that he was heartily welcome. The Table being spread with variety of Dishes, the King sate down to his Meat, eating very heartily of a Loyn of Beef, commonly called a Sir-Loyn of Beef; insomuch that the <hi>Abbot</hi> took
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37278:4"/> great notice of him, to see how he laid about him, first cutting a good sizeable piece, then calling for a Glass of his Claret, drank it off, and then sell to his Beef afresh, continuing eating until he had made a pritty handsome hole in the Sir-Loyn of Beef, said the <hi>Abbot,</hi> much good may it do you sir, I perceive you have a good Stomach to your meat, I would give an hundred pounds with all my Heart, I had so good a stomach as you have; you see of all this variety of meats here is, I can hardly eat any thing, a pestle of a Lark is as much as I have eaten. The King returned him thanks, and withal told him, that he had a pritty good stomach, and wished his Lordship as good a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach as he had, the King having plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully refreshed himself at the Lord <hi>Abbots</hi> Table; after grace was said, he took his leave of his Lordship, giving him thanks for his kind and hearty Entertainment, further telling him, that he belonged to the Court, and that he would let his Majesty know how kindly he had entertained him.</p>
               <p>The King having mounted his Horse rode immediately to the Forrest, where
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37278:5"/> it was not long before he found his company, who (though they had missed him) could not imagine where he had been, but still went on to pursue their sport, until such time they had killed the Deer; that being ended he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>London.</hi>

               <p>Now all places, Court and City were fill'd with the News of the Lord Abbots Imprisonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> but could not imagine what was the reason of it; some judging one thing, some another, according to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral apprehensions, and private conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the matter, but came still very short of what was the true and real cause of his Imprisonment: Now if others were so much troubled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to know what was the real cause of his Imprisonment, you may well think that the Lord Abbot was highly troubled and perplexed to see himself deprived of his stately Palace and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Walks, his variety of palata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Dishes, his choice of rare and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Wines, and the company of his comfortable Friends, and of a suddain to be Confined to a close and dismal Prison, and to be fed only with Bread and Water; and what was most of all, he knew not for what reason, nor wherein he had offended his Majesty; he therefore writ to his friends to make intercession for him to the King for his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37278:6"/> liberty, and that he might have a better allowance of meat and drink, but if they could not prevail in that, he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to learn for what cause he was so closely Imprisoned; or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had so grievously and hainously offended the King, for he did seriously profess he was wholly ignorant of the matter: Now his Friends were not idle, but did earnestly Solicite his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty on his behalf, but to little or no purpose, for the King was extreamly Averse to all their Intercessions; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they learn from the King wherein the Abbot had offended him.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37278:7"/> Majesty will take pitty on you, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you a greater liberty, and better and more plentiful Dyet. The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> went accordingly to the King, letting him know how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly the Lord Abbot was grieved and troubled for his offence, and that he did seriously profess he was wholly ignorant wherein he had offended your Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

He therefore told the Lieutenant he would not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to his further enlargement, or that he have better Dyet, but charged him to be sure to let him have Bread and Water enough and that he should bring him word the next day how it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Abbot.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37278:7"/> he was very sorry, so taking his leave of the Abbot for that night, went away, leaving the Abbot to his repose, and his sorrowful comfort of Bread and Water.</p>
               <p>Now the next day (according to his usual custom) he went to visit the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, whom he found very pensive and melancholly; indeed, said the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it troubles me much to see you so melancholly, and that I cannot help you. Ah! Sir, replyed the Abbot, I should be much merrier had I but a Joynt of good Meat, and a Glass of good Wine; for indeed I am so hungry that I am ready to eat my own flesh: truly, said the Lieutenant, I date not give it you, it is as much as my life is worth if I do: I have such strict Order to the contrary, from the King: But I will go to his Majesty once more on your behalf; for which the Abbot kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thanked him.</p>
